# Documentation

This is the documentation for the affiliations service. We follow the
[Divio documentation organization system](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction.html).

- [Tutorials](./tutorial.md) (learning-oriented)
    - Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of
      steps to complete a project of some kind. Unlike how-to guides, tutorials
      don't assume lots of prerequisite knowledge.
    - [Get started](./tutorial.md#get-started)
- [How-to guides](./howto.md) (problem-oriented)
    - How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a
      real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific
      end. Unlike tutorials, they typically assume a fair amount of prerequisite
      knowledge.
    - [Run code checks](./howto.md#run-code-checks)
    - [Organize imports and constants](./howto.md#organize-imports-and-constants)
    - [Write a TODO comment](./howto.md#write-a-todo-comment)
    - [Write a commit message](./howto.md#write-a-commit-message)
    - [Set up Postgres locally](./howto.md#set-up-postgres-locally)
    - [View info on AWS](./howto.md#view-info-on-aws)
    - [View logs on AWS](./howto.md#view-logs-on-aws)
    - [Deploy to AWS](./howto.md#deploy-to-aws)
- [Explanations](./explanation.md) (understanding-oriented)
    - Explanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
      They broaden the documentation’s coverage of a topic. Explanations can
      equally well be described as discussions; they are discursive in nature.
      They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the
      software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even
      from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being
      read at leisure, rather than over the code.
    - [Affiliations workflow diagrams](./explanation.md#affiliations-workflow-diagrams)
    - [Environment variables](./explanation.md#environment-variables)
- [Reference guides](./reference.md) (information-oriented)
    - Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to
      operate it. Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are
      code-determined, because ultimately that’s what they describe: key
      classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions,
      fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
